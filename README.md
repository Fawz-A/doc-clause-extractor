# doc-clause-extractor

---
OCR- PDF and image clause extraction tool that converts structured document clauses (e.g. 6.1.2) into formatted Excel output.

This script uses Reg-ex and Tesseract.
Reg-ex for structuring the columns and to know when to linebreak.
Tesseract used for OCR capabilities.

-  PDF text extraction (pdfplumber)
-  Image OCR support (Tesseract)
-  Clause parsing (e.g. 6.1, 6.1.2, 3.2.4)
-  Structured Excel export
-  Multi-file upload (Streamlit UI)
-  Wrapped text formatting
-  Frozen headers + clean column sizing



## Requirements

This project requires **Tesseract OCR** installed on your system.

### macOS
```bash
brew install tesseract
```

### Ubuntu / Debian
```bash
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
```

---

## Setup (Recommended)

Create and activate virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Run Locally (Frontend - Streamlit App)

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

App will open at:
```
http://localhost:8501
```

---

## Run Locally (Backend Script Only)

```bash
python convert.py
```

This runs the standalone conversion script without the UI.

---

## Docker (Optional)

```

Run container:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 doc-clause-extractor
```
